I started with just 4 students and by the end of the year, I was juggling with 40 students while helping dad to run his real estate business. They just kept coming for the next 10 years!

At Gallup, I had the opportunity to work with global leaders, psychologists, researchers, subject matter experts, consultants and coaches. For 6 years, I was coached and developed to expand and play to my strengths. I have been very fortunate to be coached, trained and certified by Gallup's very own Clifton StrengthsFinder Guru, Curt Liesveld who passed away a year later. It was his first and only visit ever to Singapore to train me. Curt had told me at the end of the training, ""Dahlia, you are made for this. You gotta believe it."" And so did many others including my clients. I made a vow that I will continue to live his legacy and share his positive light. With that and love, I work my way with many AMAZING people to Euphoric Coaching.

For a white collar in his early 30s who is earning a comfortable 5-figure income, many will agree the corporate ladder is ""The Way"" moving forward.   However, for a motivated & determined ""go-getter"", Alvin was hungry for the next breakthrough in his career, a bona-fide & life-changing breakthrough. Instead of being a part of a success story, he was determined to build his own success story.  Hence, Intense feasibility studies were carried out & finally options were being layed out:  1) Remain in a sheltered environment, continue to meet the management KPI, climb the corporate ladder & possibly look forward to a predictable retirement.  Or   2) Take the plunge, get out of his comfort zone, prepare for a pay-cut or pay loss, pull longer hours; so he can get to help his network and himself nurture & grow wealth through asset strategizing.  The choice was clear & there was no turning back...  In 2009, feeling confident he can apply 7-years of proven Sales & Marketing success, Alvin entered the Real Estate industry.   Nonetheless, It was not a full ""bed of roses"". During the first year, learning curve was steeper than expected, quality time with loved ones significantly impacted, income slumped more than 70% year-on-year & to add, Marketing Costs eating fast into his savings. First year's result was lacklustre to say the least & Alvin was almost making a living from ""hands to mouth"".  You know what they say ""when one door closes, heaven open up many doors for you.....

Why the real estate industry? Basically because I always have a keen interest in the property market, am passionate about the various properties out there and also because of the fact that property is one of the best investment vehicle, especially in land scarce Singapore. With its interestingly diverse culture, excellent governance, a stable & ever growing economy, a strong currency; it is no wonder that Singapore is widely recognized to be one of the safest & livable countries in the world. With the government’s initiatives to increase the population & to continuously make Singapore a vibrant, world class country & business hub; the property industry has proved to be filled with vast & lucrative opportunities. As such, each time I facilitate a property transaction, I am helping clients to attain a better quality of life either by having made money or by planting seeds that will flourish over time. This ‘social service’ plus the delight shown by my clients truly heighten my own sense of satisfaction. I focus on Industrial and Commercial properties & have helped hundreds of MNCs, SMEs & Government Institutions realize their business goals by buying, selling & leasing Warehouses, Factories, Offices, Retail Outlets & Buildings. I am now living my dream & is my group of realtors. So Sellers, Buyers, Landlords, Tenants, fellow Agents, potential Agents; Let’s continually improve the quality of our lives & the lives of our loved ones together! When you succeed, I succeed!

Along the way, we have kept our independence as a design and advertising studio, become a full-fledged member of Singapore’s 4As and evolved to build a third arm of business in the form of event design and management.  But more importantly, we have learned to always respect and listen to what our clients need. This means cultivating an attitude of receptiveness to feedback and ideas, and a collaborative spirit that starts within the studio and extends to our business relationships. It’s never easy, and sometimes it takes many projects or even years before the trust builds up to an almost intuitive understanding, that really smoothes the way for our creative efforts to shine.  So when it came time to refresh our own look (since the last update in 2005 – we design to last!), we asked ourselves, “How can we capture the essence of what came before and also who we have come to be?” The answer is this new site and identity.  ‘Where great ideas connect’ describes what Grid is – it recalls our design roots, our adherence to time-tested creative processes, and the strong connections between our work, our clients and us.","","https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=GRID%20Pte%20Ltd",,,,"Crecept Pte Ltd","Writer","Nov 2013","May 2014","","","https://www.linkedin.com/company/1273571","1273571",,,"Noisy Crayons","Communication & Engagement Associate","Aug 2013","Sep 2013","We are Asia’s leading digital-creative company.
