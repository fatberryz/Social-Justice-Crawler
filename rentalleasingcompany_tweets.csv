596|Just added the Audi R8 to our collection of cars. Next week, the new Ferrari. (The model is a surprise!)
597|Silly Singaporeans. Calling at 1:30am on Xmas day for a car next week.
598|Silliest thing ever. One of our customer needed a SLK because she needs to shop fast for Xmas!
599|You just can't stop laughing if your car rental coy 'A' calls you because they need to rent a car from you.
600|With so many weddings, December is the new February. Just completed a special hunting request of 5 Honda Jazz for a Wedding.
601|A film company just contacted us to rent the brand new Hyundai i35. Apparently, Hyundai is their sponsor. Silly, should have gone to Komoco!
602|One of our fan shared this photo with us and we thought it was really funny! http://t.co/8xNCWMmM
603|A customer's car just broke down. Ah engine troubles, part of the automotive 'freedom'!
604|It is a great sign when a client (the husband) uses Drive.SG and another client (the wife) does so too separately!
605|A great week at Drive.SG. We are not bracing ourselves for the mad xmas, new year, lunar new year rush!
606|We gave one of our fans a surprise upgrade for his wedding. He was expecting a Toyota Rush and we delivered a Mercedes!
607|Drive.SG just made new friends with Express Cars, National Car Rental and Alpine! Can't wait to add them.
608|Followed up with our contest winners. Some of them are already planning a fun weekend drive with the family. How nice!
609|Just released the results for the 15th Nov Guess-a-Car contest. We are glad our fans enjoyed the little puzzle.
610|The weirdest thing just happened. PayPal SG called and asked if we wanted to integrate PP into Drive.SG. Don't we already do?
611|If you think you are good at car spotting, head over to our Facebook page (http://t.co/sG2i8NPi) now!
612|Psst. Head over to our Facebook page (http://t.co/sG2i8NPi) to find the latest rental promotion for the Hari Raya Haji weekend.
613|Wow, news does travel fast. It seems that we might be appearing in a magazine soon. Thank you everyone for your support!
