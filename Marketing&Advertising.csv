Whether it's looking out for team members, bringing my highest quality work to the table, or even taking time out to self-reflect on what I'm doing well and what I can do better - I'm always motivated by a desire to improve myself and the world we live in.   Personally, I am drawn towards projects or tasks that require creativity as the icing on the cake, while the cake itself is baked with hard work, perseverance and a willingness to learn. I pride myself on being a good team-player, a skill honed through extensive academic project work, as well as through real on-the-ground experience working in service-oriented jobs.  I enjoy trying new things outside of academics, building a work-life balance, and doing my part for the community.

In my short time in SMU, I managed to clinch a place in the Dean’s List for SMU’s Lee Kong Chian School of Business (for the Year 2017-2018). I have enjoyed my time studying in SMU and will be majoring in Finance. I am also planning to take further internships related to Finance to further my experiences.  Outside of studies, Music and Japanese are two of my biggest passions. As a member of Sound Foundry I performed in their Annual Production held in September 2018 at Victoria Theatre. I also enjoy Japan-related activities and hold a Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT) Certificate at N4 level.   In addition, I currently enjoy working with animals and volunteer on an ad-hoc basis to take care of therapy cats at Love Kuching Project. While I have just started serving with the organisation, I would like to participate in organising their events in the future.  I also enjoyed engaging in physically-challenging activities in my Secondary School and Junior College days. In the Temasek Junior College Outdoor Activities Club, I planned activities such as camp-craft activities and hikes. In the National Cadet Corps, I spearheaded the creation of a website for juniors to learn Army-related content. When I graduated, I became a Cadet Officer and facilitated several events in National Cadet Corps Headquarters such as Trainfires and camps. I thoroughly enjoyed making an impact on others and would love to do more of such work in future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Singapore Armed Forces (SAF)","Technician","Apr 2015","Apr 2017","Technician during Full-Time National Service.","Singapore","https://www.linkedin.com/company/singapore-armed-forces-saf","singapore-armed-forces-saf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Singapore Management University","Bachelor of Business Administration - BBA","Business Administration and Management, General","","2017","2021","","Temasek Junior College","","","","2013","2014","",,,,,,,,"""Japanese Language Proficiency Test : 2, Music : 2, ""","",2,,"Marketing & Advertising",5,"Shu Qi Neo, Lenco Tan","Shu Neo","Lenco Tan","Temasek Junior College; Singapore Management University"

I am an undergraduate at Singapore Management University pursuing a bachelor degree in Information Systems. I will be graduating in 2022, in around 3 years' time.  I did my specialization in Marketing back while I was still studying in Ngee Ann Polytechnic. There was one particular module I did called Marketing Research that piqued my interest in the logical process of analysing the data captured and translating it into a marketing campaign.   Since then, I have taken steps to learn more about data analytics by reading on the analytical process through books and journals. I chose Information Systems for my degree to learn more about how databases are set up and to pick up the technical skills required for data analysis.   I believe that my marketing background coupled with my information systems knowledge would give me an edge in understanding the skills and requirements of business when it comes to data analysing. I have picked up basic coding languages such as SQL, Python and PHP to facilitate the process.  I aspire to gain more experience in data collection and analysis for businesses and learning more of the logical thought process behind the actions or campaigns of the industry.
