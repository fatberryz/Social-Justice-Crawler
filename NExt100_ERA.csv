This allows him full independence to determine his own market value, dictate his own working hours, and be part of something larger than himself. It has been his best decision yet.  Throughout his 7-year career as an adviser, Kah Lok found that clients and the people he met asked him similar questions. He figured the best way to help his clients and the community was to film the answers in a series of videos so that others could access the knowledge and information they required 24/7.  That led to the creation of MONEYMAP, where he filmed a series of three-minute educational videos revolving around financial literacy for the benefit of the general public. As of May 2019, he produced 40 such videos. Utilizing the power of social media, he has shared his videos on various platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and LinkedIn.   Through the exposure of his content and brand online, and by regularly keeping his clients updated via channels such as WhatsApp broadcast group, he has instilled greater confidence and trust in his professionalism.   The combination of initiatives focused on creating value for the community has elevated his business model from push to a client-attracting pull-model with clear measurable outcomes.   He has since clocked 113 five-star recommendations on his Facebook Page and his business is now 100% powered by passive referrals and existing clients only.","kahloktay",,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.facebook.com/jialefinancialplanning/",,,"finexis advisory Pte Ltd","Executive Financial Consultant","Oct 2018","PRESENT","","Singapore","https://www.linkedin.com/company/393496","393496",,,"AXA","Investment Specialist","Apr 2012","PRESENT","People buy me coffee for advice on Investments.

I am essentially a former entrepreneur with an unconventional approach to life. I believe that financial freedom and doing what you love are, in most cases, mutually exclusive and certainly should not co-exist in the word ""ambition"" (well, unless 'making money' counts as 'doing what you love').    In that spirit, I have disposed of the notion of ""ambition"" and have instead equipped myself with a mix of skills and qualifications which provide me opportunities to attain the financial security i need. My work gives me the luxury of time to pursue my dream in music - an area of talent which I seldom demonstrate in public, but dream of doing so one day not too far away.

Through my own self-discovery journey, I've found that the essence of authentic happiness always comes from within - and when we live a life of meaning and contribute our gifts to the world, we can express our soul-happiness fully and effortlessly.   As a founder and Chief Happiness Officer of Soul Happy People, my WHY is pretty simple: I want to spread joy and happiness in the workplace and everyday lives. It's my passion to inspire women to rediscover happiness, to believe in themselves, to chase dreams, and to be the “Chight” - meaning to be the change and be the light they wish to see in THEIR own lives. I enjoy bringing people together, and curating meaningful and fun events or experiences to inspire hope.    The world is my school and also my playground, and I creatively design my own curriculum.    I spent the last 20 years BEING the change, change was constant for me, and through the colourful adventures, I’ve collected many “badges”. Some of my unique expertise include Graphic Design, Jewellery Design, Marketing and Branding, Make-up artistry, Style and Image Consultancy, Right Brain Training, Event Organising, and an unconventional mom to a 10-year-old daughter. I embrace change with enthusiasm and each of them adds bling to my life’s palette.   Bringing people together is one of my natural gifts, I believed a collective effort makes greater impact.

Rising through the ranks to an Associate Director within the 6 years of professional practice, he has successfully nurtured a team of vibrant creative young minds and spearheaded numerous award-winning projects.

Leveraging on his expertise and adopting an active learner mind in this new arena, he constantly challenges himself to break new grounds and set new targets.  Prioritising his clients’ interest at the highest level of integrity, Avim has worked hard and established mutual trust and confidence among his clients and company.  Avim started off from an Associate Marketing Executive and within a year, he was promoted to Marketing Manager in November 2017, Senior Marketing Manager in February 2018 and, eventually to Marketing Director in June 2018.

I have also gained insight into how people with different worldviews think about investment and home ownership.  Real estate has always been my passion and buying a property is the largest purchase that a typical Singaporean can make in his or her lifetime.  My love for helping people was formalised through a Master degree in Professional Counselling, and I am therefore equipped to help clients work through the inevitable stress of buying or selling property. My focus is to facilitate a smooth transaction for all parties but my duty is always to negotiate the best price for my client. I apply psychological and marketing skills to my natural way with people to find the best deal possible when buying or selling property.  I am guided by strong ethical and moral values, and I seek to build a trusting, professional relationship with all clients. This philosophy of being in-sync with my clients and understanding them from their perspective, is what truly differentiates me from others in the real estate industry. Since there is hardly ever a single, perfect solution to a problem, I prefer to work on my clients’ needs and budget to formulate a plan that can achieve their real estate objective. Finally, not everyone who is contemplating putting up their home for sale might follow through with it. But the reality is that up-to-date knowledge is necessary to make an informed decision. I pride myself on being there to provide that knowledge, and am always just a call away at 96320441",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ERA Real Estate","Marketing Director","Jan 2015","PRESENT","Self Employed","Singapore","https://www.linkedin.com/company/era-real-estate","era-real-estate",,,"sia international airlines","Flight Attendant","Mar 1999","Jul 2014","","","https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=sia%20international%20airlines",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Swinburne University of Technology","masters in social science","Counseling Psychology","","","PRESENT","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""Sales : 0, Customer Service : 0, Product Development : 0, ""","",3,,"Real Estate",,,,,"Swinburne University of Technology; ERA Real Estate"

He started his first business at a tender age of 19, selling fashion sunglasses from a push-cart located at  the former World Trade Center. The business then grew into one of the biggest fashion sunglass retail  in Singapore with several outlets in popular shopping malls in town. The business was subsequently converted into full fledged optical stores with its revenue tripled within a year.   In 2010, Paul sold his optical business and decided to join the real estate industry. Armed with a Diploma in Real Estate Management previously, Paul decided to give it a shot in the industry. In the first year that he joined, he was named the ‘Top Rookie’ and ‘Top Producer’ of Huttons Real Estate Group in 2009 and then in 2010 subsequently. In 2011, he was awarded the 'Singapore’s Best Salesperson' Bronze award by SAEA (Singapore Accredited Estate Agencies).  With a passion for creating businesses, he saw a gap in the real estate industry - a missing collaborative platform for agents to collaborate and work as a team, and hence started AgentMe, a social collaborative network for real estate. The app had seen great traction and support from the industry and was handed over to the co-founder.   Currently an award-winning real estate sales agent with ERA, Paul specialises in high net worth private properties located in District 9, 10 and 11.
