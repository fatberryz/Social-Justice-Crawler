For Data Visualisation Developer role, I was in-charged to build 4 major Tableau dashboards to understand more insights about the RPA bots developed by the team thus far. I built both dynamic live dashboards and static dashboards for different purposes. For dynamic live dashboard, I handled data cleaning and join the static datasets with data from database using custom SQL script, used multiple calculated fields to simulate a live-monitoring control panel that refreshes every 5 minutes. User guide and SOP were drafted for continual use of the dashboards by the team in the future.

More? Alright, since you asked!  I started writing websites in PHP in 2008, and now write in Ruby on Rails, React/Preact and Python. I learnt Java through academia and obtained the top score at the University of London's Object-Oriented Programming examination in 2015.  While I see the benefits of object-oriented programming, I've also implemented simple python scripting for an automation framework for data pipelines in AWS to perform ETL workloads and data quality checks of processed Tableau data. This makes such checks and pipelines accessible to all levels of engineers, including BI Engineers who may not have programming backgrounds.  Some might say that strongly-typed languages slow development speed, but I find that it helps in long-term maintainability and in development teams, which led me to use TypeScript while working in Visa and in all my subsequent JS work. Coupled with strong CI/CD workflows, this has brought about a higher level of confidence in the code that we produced at Hackwagon Academy, where I wrote a full-stack, multi-tenant HR/payroll platform to support the operations team's unique processes.  Other than writing code, maintaining network equipment takes up most of my time. It gives my slight OCD a good kick when WiFi deployments are appropriately sized and secured. Other than that, I also enjoy helping my friends out with their programming questions, which is why I used to spend weekends in Singapore at Hackwagon.com teaching Python and Full-stack Web Development. Otherwise, I'm on StackOverflow reviewing queues or on GitHub submitting PRs.

I believe that having a diversified set of skills is not only essential to the current workplace, but it also provides me with stability.  In this volatile day and age, it is important for me to find stability in the work I do and the life I live to achieve peace. Witnessing first-hand the horrors a single recession can do to a man's pride and even his will to live, I vowed to myself to never have to let myself, or anyone I hold close to me go through such an ordeal again.   While diversity and stability brings me peace, innovation brings me joy. Innovation allows me to think creatively, and execute ideas that can be absolutely ridiculous, yet engaging and fun! Innovation is also the criteria that is required for companies to get ahead of each other and boost their competitiveness. In my opinion, it brings satisfaction to the innovator, and colour to the world.  Hence, diversity, stability and innovation are goals that I keep close to my heart. I seek to improve myself every day to get closer to these goals as I believe they can bring me peace and joy, and benefit the society and workplaces that I reside in.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Singapore Management University","Teaching Assistant","Aug 2019","PRESENT","IS110-Information Systems and Innovation under Professor Patrick Thng","Singapore","https://www.linkedin.com/company/singapore-management-university","singapore-management-university",,,"KeyReply","Software Engineer Intern","Aug 2019","PRESENT","•Hold duties in software development and engineering, technical documentation, data processing, software testing.  •Test and update front-end and back-end codes","Singapore","https://www.linkedin.com/company/keyreply","keyreply",,,"SMU Ambassadorial Corps","Junior Ambassador","Mar 2019","PRESENT","• Represent SMU to provide a unique student perspective on the various school facilities, and how these have shaped our SMU stories  • Hosts distinguished guests and SMU’s external stakeholders for external and internal e","","https://www.linkedin.com/company/smu-ambassadorial-corps","smu-ambassadorial-corps",,,"First Code Academy","Coding Instructor","May 2019","Aug 2019","• Empower children with the knowledge of coding and computational thinking.  • Prepare and instruct coding lessons for various languages like Python, Mindcraft, Scratch Jr, HTML etc for children and teenagers aged 3 - 18 years old.","Stamford Court","https://www.linkedin.com/company/first-code-academy","first-code-academy",,,"Grab","Temp.

Once closed to the idea of boring databases and the over-saturated market of mobile development, I see opportunity everywhere and I am open to learning what ever new technologies that may come.  Starting from a humble Microsoft Access Application at the age of 16, I am proud to have developed innovative E-Business Web Applications and mobile applications. I even had the chance to develop a cross-platform mobile application for a multi-national company,Y&R New York.  Creative. Curious.Analytical. Problem solver. This is how I would describe myself. Always questioning the norm, I seek to come up with innovative ideas and finding better ways to do things. This nature of me has led me to find issues and bugs in the frameworks I have worked with and even coming up with temporary work-around solutions.   What is important to me in IT  ----------------------------------------- -Sharing knowledge is important in the IT industry and it builds communities around us  One such profound example for me was when I was learning JQuery Mobile and Phonegap. The online community was really helpful to me when I was in need of quickly learning the technologies in order to develop an application. Soon, I was contributing back and helping identify issues and coming up with solutions to problems. These acts of contribution have since left a lasting impression on how I see the IT and developing world around me. This is why I enjoy what I do.  -Its not just about the technical skills  Multifaceted skills sets are important because one has to be adaptable to their environment. The relationship between business and IT was one of the first reasons why I wanted to learn IT. Over time, I realized it is useful and has sparked my interest to develop a variety of skills from soft skills to leadership to marketing strategies and even human psychology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"VMware","Associate Consultant","Jul 2019","PRESENT","","Singapore","https://www.linkedin.com/company/vmware","vmware",,,"Singapore Management University","Student","Aug 2015","PRESENT","","Singapore","https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=Singapore%20Management%20University",,,,"Huobi Global","IT Team","Apr 2018","Aug 2018","[About Huobi] Huobi Global is a world-leading cryptocurrency financial services group.

I like digging into problems and solving them using modern technology. This passion carried me through my education at National University of Singapore School of Computing and I remain fascinated about being at the forefront of technology.  I used to think that I like Marketing, specifically Digital Marketing. I particularly enjoyed Graphic Design, Search Engine Optimization, and Customer Analytics. My projects were well received by the management and I was endorsed for delivering results beyond set parameters to strengthen insights. 2 years of a full-time job on top of part-time gigs, affirmed me that my yearn to grow and learn something different was unsatisfied by this specialized field.   My year of IT Project Management at a technology start-up was also an eyeopener; I enjoyed analyzing business requirements, coming up with roadmaps as well as doing project management taking into account the scope of project, budget, and resources available. I was told that I had a flair for that. However, there was a nagging sensation at the back of my head - How can I do IT Project Management well without knowing what the designers or software engineers actually go through?   I then stumbled upon Software Engineering. While I also appreciate learning about Backend development, Frontend development in particular calls to all my passions. It incorporates my existing design capabilities, creative flair, problem-solving skills and provides me with instant gratification. I soon realized that the best-looking design may not be the most intuitive and natural interaction-point. There, I see a gap I should fill, leading me to my current role as a part time UIUX designer as I hustle through my last semester in school.
