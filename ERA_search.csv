This allows him full independence to determine his own market value, dictate his own working hours, and be part of something larger than himself. It has been his best decision yet.  Throughout his 7-year career as an adviser, Kah Lok found that clients and the people he met asked him similar questions. He figured the best way to help his clients and the community was to film the answers in a series of videos so that others could access the knowledge and information they required 24/7.  That led to the creation of MONEYMAP, where he filmed a series of three-minute educational videos revolving around financial literacy for the benefit of the general public. As of May 2019, he produced 40 such videos. Utilizing the power of social media, he has shared his videos on various platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and LinkedIn.   Through the exposure of his content and brand online, and by regularly keeping his clients updated via channels such as WhatsApp broadcast group, he has instilled greater confidence and trust in his professionalism.   The combination of initiatives focused on creating value for the community has elevated his business model from push to a client-attracting pull-model with clear measurable outcomes.   He has since clocked 113 five-star recommendations on his Facebook Page and his business is now 100% powered by passive referrals and existing clients only.","kahloktay",,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.facebook.com/jialefinancialplanning/",,,"finexis advisory Pte Ltd","Executive Financial Consultant","Oct 2018","PRESENT","","Singapore","https://www.linkedin.com/company/393496","393496",,,"AXA","Investment Specialist","Apr 2012","PRESENT","People buy me coffee for advice on Investments.
