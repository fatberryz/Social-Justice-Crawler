I can’t guarantee you’ll be able to bring home a paycheck next week. However, what I can guarantee is that if you can’t due of illness or death, you will have peace of mind knowing your family will be protected.  Hi I’m Hensa, thank you for visiting my profile. I help provide insurance, wealth and financial advice to my clients.   Insurance and financial planning is something we tend to put off for ‘another day’. Unfortunately for some, this lack of prior planning can have a significant impact on loved ones. I’ve experienced this first-hand.  Growing up, my father ran a manufacturing business for over 40 years in Indonesia. Sadly, he passed away suddenly and at the same time, didn’t have sufficient financial planning and protection in place to take our family through during this difficult time. Without any financial backing or insurance, our family had no choice but to let go of the business.   Having gone through this experience, I’ve worked hard, pushing for financial independence and ensuring I have all the proper plans and risk management in place to ensure my mother, wife and children are taken care of – should anything unexpected happen to me.   Now working at one of Singapore’s leading insurance firms, AIA, I am driven to help my friends, family, clients and fellow business owners to grow, preserve and protect their wealth. Not only that, I understand the pain, the challenges and complications of when things go wrong, hence I ensure that I’ll be there to guide you through the difficult times.  ✔ Talk to me about:  - Corporate Risk Management Solutions & Employee Benefits - Personal Insurance Solutions - Wealth Preservation & Growth Solutions  Allow me to help you put the right measures in place for your unique financial position.    ✔ Let’s start working together:  ✉ hensa@aia.com.sg ✆ +65 9821 194";;;;;;;;;;;;;;"http://www.hensa-insurance.com";;;"AIA";"Personal Wealth Director | Financial Services Manager";"Jul 2015";"PRESENT";"AIA Singapore, set up in 1931 is part of the AIA Group, which today is the largest independent publicly listed pan-Asian life insurance group in the world and the second largest life insurance company in the world by market capitalisation.

In my daily conversations over coffee and meals, i often hear about the frustrations, challenges and complexities that you face on the many financial products available in the market and it is only natural if you fall into the trap of paralysis analysis.  Because, you want the best for yourself and your loved ones.  What is the best?  Over the years, i learned and found that successful financial planning is simplifying the process, knowing your outcomes and taking action. In the process, i want to help you answer 3 universal questions.  1. What if you live too long? 2. What if you are gone too soon? 3. What if you cannot work due to a major injury or traumatic illness?  Having a process provides clarity and certainty knowing that you will achieve your outcomes. I am committed to help you make meaningful decisions to live life on your own terms financially.  Living is not only about working. Sports and traveling are ways for me to balance my life. Staying active is key to maintaining vitality and a high energy level, while visiting different countries is an opportunity to see the world differently and appreciate what we have. It is an invaluable life experience.  My direction into leadership and volunteering is exciting as i am able to give back through mentoring and coaching. The financial services industry has seen its fair share of talent leak and mis-matchers. I hope to give people who are considering a professional sales career a picture of the industry's good, bad and the ugly. If the fit is right, the work we do, besides being meaningful, will bring freedom of personal development and income longevity.

Retirement planning starts as soon as you starts to earn your first dollar . In this way , you can do it with less effort and easier to become part of your monthly expenditure . Furthermore , you do not have to subject to huge risks to earn for you the returns that you need .  A lot of people always believe that retirement is years away before they will start planning for it but the actual fact is time passes very fast and in no time a decade had passed , just when you looked back the time when certain events had happened , then you realized ""OMG"" , so many years had passed already , still thinking was just last year affair. This bring you back to the reality that you are not very far from your retirement . And also due to aging population across the world , you can depend lesser and lesser on your children ( if have any) to take care of your retirement . They may turn around to depend on you instead especially with the cost of living going up faster than their salaries .  So don't procrastinate but look into your retirement planning now and decide if you want to retire at 50% , 100% or 150% or more of your current lifestyle .";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"AIA";"Senior Financial Services Consultant( MDRT Member)";"Mar 1997";"PRESENT";"Specialized in retirement planning";"3 Tampines Grande 08-56 AIA Tampines Singapore 528799";"https://www.linkedin.com/company/406952";"406952";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"AIA Singapore Pte Ltd";"";"";"";"";"PRESENT";"";"Ngee Ann Polytechnic";"";"";"";"1989";"1993";"";"Tanjong Katong Secondary School";"";"";"";"1986";"1989";"";"""Retirement Planning : 1, Insurance : 1, Estate Planning : 1, """;"";2;;"Financial Services";5;"Dave Loh AFP,AEPP,IBFQ,IDA, Bobo Tan";"Dave Loh";"Bobo Tan";"Ngee Ann Polytechnic; AIA; Ian Bremmer"

My work involves designing solutions to help clients accumulate and preserve their wealth.   I believe the first step in financial planning is to lend a pair of listening ears to my clients’ issues, challenges and what bothers them most in their minds.  I believe no solutions will work without a thorough understanding of clients’ concerns and issues.    Hence, I will only proceed to design solutions to my clients’ problems after a good understanding of the issues on hand through my good listening ears, coupled with my proven fact finding system to diagnose the problems and implementation of the solutions.   My Philosophy in life My philosophy in life is ‘do not do unto others what you don’t want others do unto you’.     What my clients say of me? I am known by my clients to be professional and passionate in the things I do.  My eye for details, while keeping a clear focus on the big picture, has benefited my clients greatly in the implementation of their financial roadmap.

I believe in life long learning, which is why I consistently upgrade myself so that I could always add value to the table. Through the various approaches such as attending seminars or certifications, it has helped to sharpen my analytical and problem solving skills while broadening my experiences.   Similar to many others, I enjoy travelling the world as well. The only difference being, I’d love to do it through backpacking, as I travel to see the world in a different light.

As a millennial myself, a longer life expectancy coupled with the rising cost of living definitely scares me. Through the sharing of concepts, I wish to help other like-minded individuals to be better prepared for their future. By adopting accurate Cashflow Planning, they will be able to venture into new investment opportunities to ensure the sufficiency during their Retirement years.  For Corporations, I help to identify the various gaps that may result in huge cash outflow and provide tangible solutions to it. Common issues include business disruption through unforeseen disasters, Keyman Insurance and much more. Through appropriate measures, these ‘disasters’ are recoverable. On top of it, initiatives such as a Staff Retention Programme are suggested to allow Corporations to enhance staff benefits.

I am a huge fan of sports - I play competitive football on a regular basis and indulge in the occasional weightlifting. I enjoy travelling, film photography, sitcoms, music such as Hip-Hop, Rhythm and Blues and catching up on Pop culture. Quality time with family and friends is a must.
